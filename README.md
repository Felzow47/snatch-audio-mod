# DON'T INSTALL IT IS BROKEN FOR NOW 

if you installed it and get your premiere pro broken
goto ```C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Temp``` and cut the folder named ```Adobe``` and paste it on desktop just for be sure and your premiere pro is fixed

## Mandatory user agreement:

This is not a means to promote or facilitate piracy. This is a personal tool I've found that I could use for practicing my own video editing using **legal** content or Fair Use contexts, and by using this tool you're agreeing to my definition of a Good Faith principle: _I've built something that I offer you for free and which could be used for either good or evil, but we both agree to choose good instead of evil and when you willingly go against this it doesn't make you clever or savvy, it makes you a bad person._ If you _were_ so clever, you could and would've made it yourself.

# FAQ

## How do I install this?

For the moment there is no ZXP so download the **beta version** from [here](https://github.com/Felzow47/snatch-audio-mod/releases) 

On **Windows** Goto in ```C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions``` Create a folder named ```com.snatchaudio.panel``` drag and drop all the file from the zip in the folder you just created 

~Just download the ZXP from [Release page](https://github.com/Felzow47/snatch-audio-mod/releases) and install it with [ZXP Installer by Elements](https://zxpinstaller.com/) or [ZXP Install by aescripts](https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer/)~



## How do I download this?

No real release for the moment the **beta** download is [here](https://github.com/Felzow47/snatch-audio-mod/releases)

~Download it from the Release page  
[Download Zxp Release](https://github.com/Felzow47/snatch-audio-mod/releases)~

## Does this support **\_\_\_\_\_\_**?

If it's anything more complex than a plain URL (no added time parameters) at the highest available quality, then probably not. I don't plan on developing this much further because I don't personally have a need for other features, plus I have no idea if any one in the world is going to use it.

## Can it support downloading segments of videos?

Theoretically, but it's something I'd need to devote a lot of time to because ytdl-core allows you to determine a start bit and end bit to download a segment, but I'd need to convert timestamps to bits reliably and build a UI component which makes timestamps easy to input.

## Can I download audio only?

As of v1.1, there are new settings that allow you to Snatch the best audio, best video, or (when both are disabled) snatch the default best combination up to 720p.

and with the mp3 fix you can download audio only without import error with the wav "auto renamer" 
## Is this sketchy?

I designed the tool I wanted to use because I was tired of relying on sketchy websites or programs I couldn't trust only to import fair use content into PPRO any way. If it were sketchy, I wouldn't be putting all the exposed source code on my Github profile with my real name, credentials, and contact information. I've nothing to hide and there will never be any kind of advertising or file injection via this tool provided it isn't modified and distributed by someone other than me.

## Can it download 1080p with audio?

Currently >1080p downloads without audio because Youtube does not stream them together. I spent a few hours getting this to work through an FFMPEG binary. The short answer: yes but it's extremely slow. The long of it: right now the panel is 3mB total, adding FFMPEG brings the size up to 41mB which makes it load and run much slower. Re-encoding (at least with the settings I'd used) HD footage with HD audio was also very slow, taking about 2 minutes for a video with a runtime of 3:25. It'd actually be far quicker to Snatch the best video and Snatch the best audio or download these separately and align them in your timeline, and it doesn't make much sense for a workflow tool to be needlessly slow.

If I find that I can speed this process up, I'll revisit it.

## Can I choose the exact format of what I download?

Maybe, but this isn't as straightforward as you might think. The majority of available qualities are encoded as vp9 or other encodings that aren't support by PPRO at all, while you can download and attempt to import them PPRO will flag it as a faulty import. The list is very small when we exclude these, and I feel the Best Audio / Best Video / Good Both options are intuitive enough to cover most needs.

## I get an error saying "File of this same path is in use by the app"

PPRO is kind of greedy with file access once you import files. The panel can and should be removing any files that would share the same name as a new download, but the app may have locked read/write privileges because it's currently reading the file, even if that file is no longer in your project panel. This causes an EPERM (permissions) error, and is something I can only warn a user about but not manually fix.

## It isn't working for a certain Youtube link

It doesn't support youtu.be syntax, but it also does not support:

- Videos regionally locked from your location
- Private or unlisted videos
- Rentals or purchases
- Youtube Premium content
- Non-HLS (or currently broadcasting) livestreams

## ^ Can it support those?

No, because **this is not a piracy tool.**

## Any plans for adding other platforms beyond Youtube?

Not at the moment because I was exploring the [ytdl-core](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core#readme) API and this relies on it to do the heavy lifting.

## It isn't working like in these videos on my computer and with my version of the apps. Where do I file a bug report?

It's best to do it here on Github in the Issues panel. I do actively respond to threads I've made showcasing it on reddit so if you reply to me there, I'm guaranteed to read it and (unless it's been mentioned many times before) almost guaranteed to reply.

## Can I donate or buy you a coffee? the donate link is not for me is for [Inventsable](https://github.com/Inventsable)

I had a lot of requests for this, so [I've included a donate link](https://paypal.me/inventsable?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US) in the context menu when you right click on the panel. This tool is and will always be free, but if it happens to be a godsend for your work in particular and you feel the need to show some appreciation, I certainly appreciate it as well -- not to mention this gives me a lot more incentive and freedom to actively pursue updating this tool and adding requested features.

## Why does it say "used by node-jquest" in the Github sidepanel?

ðŸ¤· Cue Metal Gear Solid time paradox screen. Github looks through `./package.json` files to match names and will automate this, and apparently there was an NPM package named [snatch](https://github.com/coverslide/node-jquest/blob/master/package.json#L13) used in this repository. This isn't an NPM module and I promise that isn't exporting anything, but apparently Github has mistaken this repo as matching a 9+ year old NPM package because the names are the same and unfortunately I have no control over that.

## Why does this look so similar to [Timelord and Anubis from Battle Axe](https://www.battleaxe.co/)?

Because it shares the same [open source component library](https://github.com/battleaxedotco/brutalism#-brutalism) as them, which you're welcome to use too.
