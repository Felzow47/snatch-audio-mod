## Mandatory user agreement:

This is not a means to promote or facilitate piracy. This is a personal tool I've found that I could use for practicing my own video editing using **legal** content or Fair Use contexts, and by using this tool you're agreeing to my definition of a Good Faith principle: _I've built something that I offer you for free and which could be used for either good or evil, but we both agree to choose good instead of evil and when you willingly go against this it doesn't make you clever or savvy, it makes you a bad person._ If you _were_ so clever, you could and would've made it yourself.

# FAQ

## How do I install this?

[Check out an explanation here](https://help.battleaxe.co/overlord/#installation).

## Does this support **\_\_\_\_\_\_**?

If it's anything more complex than a plain URL (no added time parameters) at the highest available quality, then probably not. I don't plan on developing this much further because I don't personally have a need for other features, plus I have no idea if any one in the world is going to use it.

## Any plans for adding other platforms beyond Youtube?

Not at the moment because I was exploring the [ytdl-core](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core#readme) API and this relies on it to do the heavy lifting.

## Why does this look so similar to [Timelord and Anubis from Battle Axe](https://www.battleaxe.co/)?

Because it shares the same [open source component library](https://github.com/battleaxedotco/brutalism#-brutalism) as them, which you're welcome to use too.
